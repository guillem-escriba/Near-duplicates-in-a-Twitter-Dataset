This is a website that provides COVID-19 collections of tweets, however,
they only provide the identifier of the tweet, known as a tweet-id.

To recover the entire tweet, a process commonly known as *re-hydration*
needs to be used, which involves querying an API from Twitter, giving the
tweet-id, and obtaining the tweet. This can be done with a little bit of
programming or using a software such as TWARC [2].
